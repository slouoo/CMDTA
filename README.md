# CMDTA: an advanced cross-modal deep learning framework for enhanced prediction of drug-target affinity
CMDTA is a novel deep learning framework for accurately predicting drug-target affinity (DTA). By uniquely leveraging both 1D sequence and 3D structural information through a parallel dual-path architecture, CMDTA provides a more comprehensive and precise model of molecular interactions.
